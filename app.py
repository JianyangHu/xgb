1.Shot: The number of shots taken by the team can indicate their attacking ability. A higher number of shots may increase the chances of scoring and winning the game.

2.Offside: The number of offside calls against the team may indicate their lack of coordination and timing in their attacking plays. This may decrease their chances of scoring and winning the game.

3.AirDuelWon: Winning more aerial duels can indicate the team's strength in the air and their ability to defend against high balls. This may increase their chances of preventing the opponent from scoring and winning the game.

4.Corner: Winning more corners can indicate the team's ability to create scoring opportunities from set pieces. This may increase their chances of scoring and winning the game.

5.CrossAcc: The accuracy of crosses can indicate the team's ability to deliver quality balls into the box. This may increase their chances of scoring and winning the game.

7.Tackle: The number of tackles made by the team can indicate their defensive strength and ability to win back possession. This may increase their chances of preventing the opponent from scoring and winning the game.

8.SprintD: The total distance covered by the team in sprints can indicate their fitness level and work rate. This may increase their chances of maintaining their performance throughout the game and winning the game.

9.GroundDuelWon: Winning more ground duels can indicate the team's ability to win back possession and control the midfield. This may increase their chances of creating scoring opportunities and winning the game.

10.Cross: The total number of crosses attempted by the team can indicate their attacking intent and willingness to create scoring opportunities from wide areas. This may increase their chances of scoring and winning the game.

11.LSRD: The total distance covered by the team in low-speed running can indicate their ability to maintain possession and control the tempo of the game. This may increase their chances of creating scoring opportunities and winning the game.

12.TackleWon: The percentage of tackles won by the team can indicate their defensive efficiency and ability to win back possession. This may increase their chances of preventing the opponent from scoring and winning the game.

13.HSRE: The total number of high-speed runs executed by the team can indicate their ability to create scoring opportunities and break through the opponent's defense. This may increase their chances of scoring and winning the game.

14.MSRD: The total distance covered by the team in medium-speed running can indicate their ability to transition between defense and attack and maintain their shape on the field. This may increase their chances of controlling the game and winning the game.

15.FwdPass: The number of forward passes made by the team can indicate their attacking intent and willingness to take risks. This may increase their chances of creating scoring opportunities and winning the game.
